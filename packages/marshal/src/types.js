 *
 * A Passable has a pass-by-copy superstructure. This includes
 *    the atomic pass-by-copy primitives ("undefined" | "null" |
 *      "boolean" | "number" | "bigint" | "string" | "symbol"),
 *    the pass-by-copy containers
 *      ("copyRecord" | "copyArray" | "tagged") that
 *      contain other Passables,
 *    and the special cases ("error" | "promise").
 *
 * A Passable's pass-by-copy superstructure ends in
 * PassableCap leafs ("remotable" | "promise"). Since a
 * Passable is hardened, its structure and classification is stable --- its
 * structure and classification cannot change even if some of the objects are
